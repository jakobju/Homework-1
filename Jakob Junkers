#Homework 1

#Task 1, How many genes are on chromosome II in saccharomyces_cerevisiae_R64-2-1_20150113.gff?

ls
#Look at the files.

cd S288C_reference_genome_R64-2-1_20150113/
#Change directory to S288C_reference_genome_R64-2-1_20150113.

ls
#Look at the files.

grep 'chrII'$'\t' saccharomyces_cerevisiae_R64-2-1_20150113.gff | wc -l
#grep searches for patterns and prints matching lines. wc counts the words (number of genes) and -l print the newline counts.
#output = 1556 So there are 1556 genes on chromosome II in saccharomyces_cerevisiae_R64-2-1_20150113.gff.

#Task 2, Count GC content in S288C_reference_sequence_R64-2-1_20150113.fsa.

grep -v '^>' S288C_reference_sequence_R64-2-1_20150113.fsa | tr -d 'A\|T' | grep . | wc -m
#-v inverts the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines. ^ means beginning of line. So ^> means lines starting with >.
#tr -d means deleting characters. So deleting A and T. Thus only counting G and C. -m means print the character counts.
#output = 4840231 So the number of G and C are 4840231.

GC=$(grep -v '^>' S288C_reference_sequence_R64-2-1_20150113.fsa | tr -d 'A\|T' | grep . | wc -m)
#Save the output as $GC.

$GC
#output = 4840231
#Test $GC. Shows that $GC = 4840231 = the output.

grep -v '^>' S288C_reference_sequence_R64-2-1_20150113.fsa | wc -m
#Counts all the characters (A, T, C and G).
#output = 12359733

ATCG=$(grep -v '^>' S288C_reference_sequence_R64-2-1_20150113.fsa | wc -m)
#Save the output as $ATCG.

$ATCG
#output = 12359733
#Test $ATCG. Shows that $ATCG = 12359733

echo "$GC/$ATCG" | bc -l
#echo displays a line of text. bc is a calculator language and -l defines the standard math library. 
#Together these commands calculates the ratio of GC.
#output = .39161290943744496746. So the GC content is 39 %.

#Task 3a, Download and decompress the ORFs of another strain (Y55).

cd ..
#Change to home directory.

mkdir compare
#Create a new directory called compare.

cp orf_coding_all_R64-2-1_20150113.fasta compare
#Copy the file orf_coding_all_R64-2-1_20150113.fasta to the directory called compare.

cd compare
#Change directory to compare.

wget https://downloads.yeastgenome.org/sequence/strains/Y55/Y55_SGD_2015_JRIF00000000/Y55_JRIF00000000_SGD_cds.fsa.gz
#Downloads the file.

gunzip Y55_JRIF00000000_SGD_cds.fsa
#Decompress the file.

grep -v '^>' Y55_JRIF00000000_SGD_cds.fsa | tr -d 'A\|T' | grep . | wc -m
#output = 3360772

$GC
#output = 3360772

ATCG=$(grep -v '^>' Y55_JRIF00000000_SGD_cds.fsa | wc -m)

$ATCG
#output = 8248278

echo "$GC/$ATCG" | bc -l
#The commands are the same and have the same function as in task 2.
#output = .40745134923919877579. So the GC content is 41 %.
#So the GC content is a bit higher in this strain compared to the reference strain.

#3b, Compare number of ORFs between the strains.

grep "^>" orf_coding_all_R64-2-1_20150113.fasta | wc -l
#Searches for patterns and prints the matching lines. Counts the lines (number of ORFs) starting with > and prints the newline counts. 
#output = 6713

grep "^>" Y55_JRIF00000000_SGD_cds.fsa | wc -l
#The same as above.
#output = 5330

#There are 1383 more ORFs in the reference genome.

#3c, Count the common ORFs between the strains.

grep "^>" ./Y55_JRIF00000000_SGD_cds.fsa | cut -d"_" -f 1 | sort > strain1.txt
#grep searches for patterns and prints the matching lines. cut â€”f 1 takes away the first column and -d defines the delimiter.
#sort sorts the lines of the text file and > saves the output of the previous command to the file strain1.txt

grep "^>" ./orf_coding_all_R64-2-1_20150113.fasta | cut -d" " -f 1 | sort > strain2.txt
#Same as above but for the other strain.

comm -12 strain1.txt strain2.txt | wc -l
#comm compares the number of ORFs between the two strains. wc counts the ORFs ande -l print the newline counts.
#output = 5168

#The different strains have 5168 common ORFs.
